## CYBERNEUROSIS

## Description

Cyberneurosis is an over-the-top dark theme inspired by the Cyberpunk genre and its most representative works.

High Tech, Low Life. Enjoy a theme that lets you mod your Editor outside of the official guidelines. Add  ~~broken ~~ animations and neon effects, trade  ~~sanity ~~ for enhancements.

## PSA

The project is just starting so if you find issues, awful looking combinations of the color palette for you favourite language or just want to throw a start this way, feel free to do it.

Special thanks to [Coder Coder](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCoderCoder) for their tutorial on how to create a VS Code theme and to [RobbOwen](https://github.com/robb0wen) fro creating [Synthwave84](https://github.com/robb0wen/synthwave-vscode) the best Retro Neon Theme from where I got a lot of ideas.


**Enjoy!**
